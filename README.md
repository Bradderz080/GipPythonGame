<h1>Gip</h1>
Gip is a two player game of chance, each player rolls a die and if the number is greater than 1, it is added to thier score. after a player rolls the die they have the option to roll again to add to thier potential score but if the value is 1 they lose the score for that round. both players start with a score of zero and the first to 100 wins.

For ease of use we recommend using a VPN software for both users, such as Hamachi.

To Play multiplayer gip, One user must run an instance of the server file, and both users must run an instance of the client file. the seerver file will ask for the ip and port to use for the game to be hosted on, pressing enter without inputting a custom ip or port will start the server on the local host and with a default port of 8000.
Both clients will need to use the ip and port that the serve is running on when prompted so that they can connect.

If your client does not connect to the server that is being run by another user you may need to port forward or alternatively make use of a vpn software such as Hamachi which will have you both on the same virtual lan network, skipping the need to port forward and should allow for a connection to be made easily.

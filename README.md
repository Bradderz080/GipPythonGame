<h1>Gip</h1>
Gip is a two player game of chance, each player rolls a die and if the number is greater than 1, it is added to thier score. after a player rolls the die they have the option to roll again to add to thier potential score but if the value is 1 they lose the score for that round. both players start with a score of zero and the first to 100 wins.
